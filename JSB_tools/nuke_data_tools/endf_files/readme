Place nuclear data libraries here.

The data will be fetched in endf_to_pickle.py . If the names of the library folders after downloaded and extraction change
    over time, then see global_directories.py and make sure the names changes are reflected in the section indicated by
    "specification of paths to nuclear libraries".

Also see global_directories.py for links to where to download the nuclear libraries.
